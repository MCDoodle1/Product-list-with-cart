## My process

First I designed the frontend of the app using HTML, CSS and React (Vite). After this I added the backend component using MongoDB, Express and Node.js. By using the JSON-file as backup, the frontend will also work without database connection.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - Frontend build tool
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) - MongoDB Database
- [Express](https://expressjs.com) - Express web framework for Node.js
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - Cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment

### What I learned

I practiced my knowledge of CSS and used by knowledge of MERN to add a backend functionality to a Frontend Mentor challenge.

I learned a lot about rendering data from a database and from a JSON file as backup. Especially rendering of images was difficult for me, but I succeeded in the end.

### Continued development

Extend my knowledge of fullstack applications.
